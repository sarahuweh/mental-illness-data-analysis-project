# Mental Illness Data Analysis Project

### INTRODUCTION

Some years ago, I lost a childhood friend who commited sucide. It was a very sad experience as the event took place inside his family house with his parents and siblings around. After his death, it was aparent that he was going through depression and no one noticed it as his life seemed perfect especially as he was from a wealthy family. After his death, it became clear to me that mental health is a major part of human's wellbeing. 

Lately, mental health has become a global health challenge. In the [comprehensive mental health plan (2010 - 2030](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240031029), WHO stated that "Determinants of mental health and mental disorders include not only individual attributes such as the ability to manage oneâ€™s thoughts, emotions, behaviours and interactions with others, but also social, cultural, economic, political and environmental factors such as national policies, social protection, living standards, working conditions, and community social supports". In Chapter 3 of [world mental health report](https://www.who.int/teams/mental-health-and-substance-use/world-mental-health-report), several factors stop people from seeking help for mental health conditions, including limited access to quality services, low levels of health literacy about mental health, and pervasive stigma. 

The aim of this project is to draw insights on individuals attitude and perceptions as regards mental health illness. I will analyse the data based on treatment but not in relation to geographic location or company of respondents.

**Disclaimer:** All insights I wrote here are inferences gotten from the data and it does not intend to state causes and effect.
